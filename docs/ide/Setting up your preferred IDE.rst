Setting up your preferred IDE
=============================

Integrated Development Environment (or just IDE) is a powerful tool for programmers to maximize their coding productivity. One can debug and test while at the same time utilize all the cool editing features provided by an IDE.

Since most modern IDEs are equipped with CMake support out of the box or installed as extensions/plugins, fortunately, Synfig has a working CMake build script. That means you can literally configure any of those CMake supported IDEs for Synfig development.

Choose your preferred IDE for Synfig development:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   NetBeans<NetBeans.rst>
   QtCreator<QtCreator.rst>
